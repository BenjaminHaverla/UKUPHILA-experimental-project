## About project:

We received a task from our teacher that required us to create a video using only our hands, and it should be about Life Creation. I realized that a fast and effective option would be to create a hand performance using a green screen. This way, I generated additional characters, took advantage of the green screen, and transformed everything with an engaging black silhouette style.

## Inspiration:

My inspiration came from our philosophy teacher, who spoke in interesting ways about cultures, nomads, etc. I decided to combine her lessons with my beliefs.
